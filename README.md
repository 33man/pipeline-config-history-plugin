Pipeline Config History Plugin
==============================

Jenkins plugin which, not unlike jobConfigHistory (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin),
creates a history of pipeline configurations, triggered by their builds' "onCompletion" events. 

Here you especially are able to see and compare changes in pipeline Libraries, 
which are hidden in jobConfigHistory (or replay).
